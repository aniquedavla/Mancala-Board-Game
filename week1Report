Report Week 1

4/3 ~  4/8 
 Team Name: DOTIO
 Team leader of the week: Anique
 Team members: Anique Davla, Brian Lai
Summary

We took one day to go over project requirements and deliverables individually. 
Then we realized we need a way to be able to collaborate remotely and learned and practiced GIT and decided to have Github as remote repo. 
We were able to meet in person and discuss the project, and use cases to implement. 
We tried different implementation of internal data structure of the Model to hold and update stone values in each pit or Mancula, first we started with all ArrayList. 
We rulled out ArrayList as it was inefficient to traverse between player A and B pits or Maculas in a loop, and more importantly the opposite mapping if the last stone is on an empty pit. 
We turned to LinkedList with node of pit implementation to update stone data. 
It seemed redundant so we tried a Node of Player one’s pit, and another node of player two’s pits and Maculas respectively. 
Our problem with finding the opposite pit of an empty one still remained in the LinkedList so we realized we could use a 2D array to model all pits and macula with 2 null slots to balance iteration from last pit of player A and its Macula to Player B’s pits.
We made a basic UML diagram of interactive between a GUI Board made up of ICONs and label of pits and stones. 
We coded up a basic prototype for using hard coded data structure in the model to return a 2D of stones when a certain pit was selected. We’d ideally use that 2D array to repaint view after the end of a turn. 
We plan on expanding our prototype to work with a basic GUI board and implement simple MVC with at least one Listeners.
