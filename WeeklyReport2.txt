4/10 ~ 4/15
Team Name: DotIO
Team leader of the week: Brian Lai
Team members: Brian Lai, Anique Davla

Summary:
We met up on Wednesday to discuss original design structure/pattern.
We ended up changing some aspects of the original plan, choosing an Array to implement the pits instead of 2DArrays.
We delved deeper into the design structure, drawing out a rough sketch of UML diagram.
Possible classes to think about include Board, BoardFormat, Pits, BoardView...
We settled on the idea of having View and Controller be in the same class (BoardView).
We have not yet settled on the full algorithm of the stone movement, but started to put thoughts from paper into code.
Finished Pit, Player, BoardFormat class, thinking about adding MancalaPit as a subclass of Pit.
We discussed things to understand individually before the next time we met up to combine our ideas,
such as going over the rough UML diagram and what each class should do and contain.
We encountered problems with Git and ended up spending a good amount of time working around it.

Individual Weekly Report
Name: Anique Davla

M: 4/10 || 0 hours
T: 4/11 || 0 hours
W: 4/12	|| 1.5 hours, met in person - revisited underlying data structure, an array of Pit ( that have references to Player and if it is a Mancala. We also decided to make Mancala extend Pit to have a strategy pattern. 
R: 4/13	|| 2 hours, decided remotely to have make View and Controller be one entity and Board class be model of algorithms and all the logic. I wrote a few algorithms in board to distribute stones, update the pits and mancalas with the right number of stones after distribute.  
F: 4/14	|| 3 hours, Worked on Board View to interact with basic model algorithms and it refersed the 2 drawn pitsâ€™ stones. 
A: 4/15 || 30 minutes, GIT merge conflicts, and weekly report.
